Unaufmerksam in der alten klasse

Andrew
  Engstirnig 
  Exakt präzise 
  Leute dies nebenbei noch schaffen 

  Nervous knee vom alten drummer 

Fletcher
  Namentliche erwähnung 
  Manipulative 
  Not unhonest 
  Tyranny 
  
   Is Andrew even rushing 
  
 Fletcher:
   Deliberate denounciation of Andrew. 
  
   Explicit targeting of his background.
  friendless hurts additionally 
  
   Andrew mostly is completely blindsighted. Easier to form him instead of most others 
  Empty husk 
  Arrogance
  Looking towards something, a bigger goal
 
 Fletcher
  Zuckerbrot und Peitsche
 
  Stolen folder? fletcher as thief maybe?
  Ausgegrenzt von kollegen
  
 Andrew thinking of fletcher
  HE likes me more now
 
  Not his skill but his affirmation
  No relationship with family
 
 
  Classic disappointment of following sound
  Rivalry unsafety
  Not able to rebel but forced to follow deep within him
  
  It doesnt matter if new drummer is better, he enables fletcher to have power over andrew
  
  Nobody checking him, and his relationships are not deep nor important to him
 
 
 
 Andrew
  Relinquishing his last shot at something meaningful
  Fuer eine beziehung bricht er andere beziehungen ab.
  Er glaubt an seinen skill, an seine superiority. Aber gleichzeitig gehts nur um macht
 
 
 Kinolady is echt smart lul.
  
 
 Fletcher:
  Worthless for neil
  Irish for redhead connery 
  Generic "lady/gay" threatening for most others?
  Observant in visuals not in sound?
  
 
 Fletcher
  Good in exploiting not in actual hearing? 
  Explicit hate. 
  Spiegelneuronen
 
 
  Fick die autoszene
	(Ich hab weggschaut)
 
 
 Andrew
  Aufgekratztes vernarbtes gesicht? Neurose? Von der annahme das er in shaeffer ploetzlich gott ist?
 
 
  Revenge from fletcher
 
  Lions den (Bar in der Fletcher spielt)
 
  Fletchers playing Skill is not that impressive tbh
 
  Ruined expression on Fletchers face
 
  Fletcher admitted to him using this mostly as games
 
  One last game for Fletcher, but for Andrew its serious?
 
 Fletcher
  Maybe his games are to make better musicians, but he know no bounds
 Andrew
  Found his way but is as blind? Blind towards a 30 and not towards a 1 but still.
 Fletcher
  Another admission of his games
 Andrew
  He is resocializing. 
  His rekindlement of his love to fletcher leads to a new motivation?
  Fully tied his self worth to his skill.
 
  Fun how the movie is deliberatedly not perfect but knows how it is supposed to be perfect? 
  But isnt. Still good enough but thematically its supposed to do the exact precision.
  (Kleiner Kommentar: Gegen Ende des Films wird ne Szene in perfekter Symmetrie geframed,
  Aber der abgebildete Charakter (Andrew iirc) steht offcenter, selbst nicht gerade. Das muss Absicht sein)

  Additional Notes:
  Prof. Paret:
  Fletcher sieht sich selbst als den Letzten der ein Genie erschaffen will.
  Der Letzte der nach Exzellenz strebt, koste es was es wolle.
  Parallele zu Keithing -> beide sind vom restlichen Lehrapparat abtrünnig.
